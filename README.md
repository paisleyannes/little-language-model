Basic n-gram language model


My n-gram language model delved into the pages of the Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas, crafting a dictionary that captures the word succeeding every consecutive pair within the text. Leveraging this linguistic map, the model weaves together potential sentences intended to echo the style of the book series. However, it's essential to note the model's imperfectionsâ€”most sentences may not adhere to proper grammar, and due to character constraints, many might halt abruptly mid-thought.
