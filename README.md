Basic n-gram language model

My n-gram language model used the books in the series Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas to create a dictionary of the word that follows a consecutive word pair within the text. Using this dictionary, the language model creates possible sentences which should read similar to the book series from which the model learned from. Because the model is far from perfect, most of these sentences do not make much grammatical sense, and also because the cut-off is at number of characters, many stop mid-sentence.
